Place your TU logo here as logo.png

The components (Navbar and Footer) are configured to display the logo from:
  ./public/logo.png

Image requirements:
- Filename: logo.png (or update the src="/logo.png" in Navbar.tsx and Footer.tsx)
- Format: PNG with transparent background recommended
- Size: ~512x512px or larger (will be scaled to 40-48px via CSS)
- Aspect ratio: Square preferred

Steps to add your logo:
1. Place your logo.png file in this directory (Data-Prep/client/public/)
2. The Navbar will display the logo at 40px (mobile) / 48px (desktop)
3. The Footer will display the logo at 40px
